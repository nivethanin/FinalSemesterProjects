Proposal: Multiple Regression Analysis to Predict Number of Season Wins for NBA Teams Using Python

Details: The goal of the project would be to upload and parse through historic NBA data into database, and then use a python library to assist with a multiple regression analysis to estimate the number of wins they will have for the rest of the 2022-2023 NBA Season.
Currently, the libraries I'm considering are listed below. 
I will also conduct an analysis on the accuracy of the regression analysis based predictions. 
I will be using the traditional stats such as team rebounds, assists, points, steals, blocks, turnovers, etc.


Libraries:
Pandas
Numpy
matplotlib.pyplot
seaborn
sklearn
