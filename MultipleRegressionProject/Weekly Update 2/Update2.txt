This week I was able to organize the data by copy and pasting several NBA season statistics for several years. I then figured out how to apply a linear regression library, sklearn, to it. I have screenshotted some of the results. My next steps are to look into the parameters and significance of each. Then start the writeup. I may test out several variations of the parameters so that I can find the best set of parameters to estimate total wins.
